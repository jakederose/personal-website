        <p></p>
        <p><strong>“Hello world!”</strong> I never realized those would be the first words that come with writing your first line of code. Ironically enough, I’ve had the privilege of being able to say that with my life.
        </p>
        <p>After earning my Associates in Theology, moving to Italy, learning the Italian language and pursuing my passions in church ministry, music and mentoring and teaching young people I came back to the US with a desire to try something new.</p> 
        <p>I attended Bethel School of Technology in their Full Stack Web Development coding bootcamp and was convinced this was the new adventure for me. And as I had already said Hello to the world, I said hello to the tech world and was hooked.</p>
        <p>Front-end web development is my passion. Seeing your own creativity, problem solving and organization appear and knowing it benefit others is what it’s all about for me.</p>
